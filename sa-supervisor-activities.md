## Creating New Assignments

There are three ways of creating new assignments within the SA: 
1. From the Routes tab by pressing 'Assign new drivers'. 
2. From the Driver Details panel by pressing 'Add Task'.  
3. From the Map Monitoring view on either the Routes or Drivers

<section id="Assigning-New-Drivers" markdown="1">
### Assigning New Drivers

A Supervisor can assign a new driver to a route, by following the steps below:

* From 'Routes Details' panel, tap 'Assign new drivers' as shown below

* In the 'Assign Drivers' dialogue complete the following:
  * Select type of Activity
  * Specify whether the assignment is Single-Pass or Multi-Pass  (switch the toggle on for Multi-Pass)
  * Specify whether it is a priority task (switch the toggle on to indicate yes)
  * Type a note to the driver
  * Select driver by either searching for a driver name in the search bar or pick from the drivers available based on the selected filters: Depot, defaulted to the Supervisor's Depot, and Driver Type: County or Contractor

* Tap 'Assign'

* This will add the assignment to the Route Details with the name of the Driver and the Assignment status of 'Pending' to indicate that the Assignment has been sent to the Driver but not accepted yet. It also adds the Assignment to the Future list of Assignments for the Driver, as can be seen in the next section. It also prompts the Driver in the Driver App (DA) to accept the Assignment

<section id="Completing-Assignments-for-Multi-Passes" markdown="1">
## Completing Assignments for Multi-Passes

A multi-pass Assignment (when assignment was created, the multi-pass toggle was switched to On) requires a Supervisor to determine the next step after each pass completed by the Driver. Once the Driver completes a pass, a Supervisor receives a 'Pass Completion Notice' prompt with the details about the assignment, including the number of passes made, as seen below. A Supervisor has two options: either 
1. Tap 'Another Pass' to notify the Driver to continue working on the assignment or
1. Tap 'Complete' to complete the multi-pass assignment. 

If a Supervisor selects 'Option 1' the system notifies the Driver to continue working on the assignment, i.e. make another pass. With 'Option 2' the system marks the multi-pass Assignment as Completed and removes it from the Driver's Active Assignments into the History tab

#### Pausing or Resuming Drivers

A Supervisor can pause an active Assignment that a Driver is working on by following the steps below: (the reasons to pause: refil salt or go to gas station to document that no work is being performed on the route – no breadcrumbs are accumulated)

* To resume the assignment, tap 'Resume' on the Driver that's been paused, as seen below
