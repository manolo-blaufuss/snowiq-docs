# MC311 Ticket Request Management

The MC311 system is used by Montgomery County, MD to process ticket requests that come in during the snow storm. The SNOWiQ's MC311 Tickets page allows Admin users to send the ticket requests imported from MC311 to Supervisors who will in turn assign them to Drivers during an event. Additionally, users are able to create emergency request tickets for specific addresses.

There are two ways to view the tickets: the List view and the Map View, as shown below:

<section id="Ticket-List-View" markdown="1">
## Ticket List View

This view is a standard table that allows users to close (blue 'Close' button) or assign (blue 'Send' button) tickets to Supervisors. Additionally, there are multiple filters available to narrow down the list displayed: Service Request (SR) ID, Route Name/Number, Depot, Supervisors the ticket is assigned to, Status Indicator, and Type of Ticket. A user can also filter the tickets by the time they were opened and/or closed.

<section id="Ticket-Type" markdown="1">
### Ticket Type

The Ticket Type filter allows users to view the two different types of tickets. 

* Residential (a blue circle next to the SR ID on the list): imported MC311 tickets.
* Emergency Tickets (a red asterisk next to the SR ID on the list): requests from emergency services (EMS, Fire Dept), emergency tickets created by an Admin user in Storm Operations Center, or specific requests created by a Supervisor user in Supervisor App.

A checkmark on either type of ticket indicates that the ticket is closed and has a Closed date and who closed the ticket.

</section>

<section id="Ticket-Status" markdown="1">
### Ticket Status

The Ticket Status filter allows users to view any ticket set to a specific status. 

* **New (311 and Emergency):** The system checked that the 311 ticket is valid for assignment or a new emergency ticket was created but not sent out for assignment yet. 
* **Sent:** The Admin user reviewed the ticket and sent it to a Supervisor App (SA) for assignment creation.
* **Assigned:** The Supervisor created the Assignment in the SA and sent it to the Driver, but the work hasn't begun yet.
* **In Progress:** The Driver began working on the ticket assignment.
* **Closed:** 
   1. An Admin user manually closes a ticket that they deem invalid or that doesn't need work.
   1. The system has checked the service request and found it invalid and set the ticket to closed.
   1. The assigned driver has completed the task and marked the assignment as completed - Which closes the ticket throughout all systems.
* **Pending:** The system found the ticket to be invalid and is preparing to close the ticket.

<section id="Ticket-Import-Validation-Rules" markdown="1">
### Ticket Import Validation Rules

System identifies the route by the address of the ticket and Checks if the route is being treated/plowed.

* If route is not yet started (=unassigned, pending or assigned status) - auto-close the ticket.
* If route has been started (=started state) but there're no breadcrumbs near the address in the ticket - auto-close the ticket.
* If route is started and there are breadcrumbs near the address on the ticket, or route is in completed/inspected status - 311 ticket should remain open (do not auto-close tickets for areas that haven't been serviced yet.)

<section id="Ticket-Map-View" markdown="1">
## Ticket Map View

This view provides a panel on the left that lists the tickets and their statuses and also a visual on the map of markers (color coded) that represent tickets to give users an idea of where the tickets are located in the service area. Additionally, clusters are visible when the map is zoomed out.

Clicking on the blue arrow next to the ticket in the left panel or on the marker on the map produces a popup with the details of the ticket, as seen below. It also allows to either Close or Send a ticket.

<section id="Clusters" markdown="1">
### Clusters

When a user zooms outs, markers with numbers inside them appear called 'clusters' that de-clutter the map and group together like markers. Clicking on a cluster allows the user to zoom in on that area and view the separated markers on the map.

* Click the blue 'Send' button (List View – located all the way on the right of the ticket; Map View – in the popup details for the ticket)
* Enter value in the Note field and select a Supervisor from the dropdown and click 'Send,' as shown below.
