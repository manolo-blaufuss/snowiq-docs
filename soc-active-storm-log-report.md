## Active Storm Log

The Active Storm Log page is an Event Log that allows Admin users a closer look into the actions, the users, and timestamps of the actions for the current active Event. As seen below, the log shows the time the action occurred in the system, what the action was, and who performed it (user name or system). Actions may include creating an Assignment, activating a new Phase for a Depot, or changing the status of a Driver.

## Active Storm Report

The Active Storm Report page allows Admin users to view Event Progress in the Statistics Dashboard, using widgets and graphs that are updated in near-real time. The default tab 'Storm Event' that opens is the overall county statistics for the Event with data such as when the event activated and ended, predicted duration, active staff, miles plowed, total snowfall, and salt usage. More granular reporting can be found in other tabs: Phase, Route, Driver, and Salt Usage.
